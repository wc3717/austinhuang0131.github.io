**Do NOT use dis.cool.** They scraped "35,000 servers, 12 million users" (according to its owners!) without consent by abusing the widget feature. **Please turn off Widget on your server.** This kind of thing has happened 2 times. We don't want a third.

### Bots
Ordered by server count as of October 11, 2019.

* [DSC](https://discordbots.org/bot/415773861486002186) (3218 servers, 2 hour bump interval)
* [Bump Central](https://discordbots.org/bot/478290034773196810) (2412 servers, 1 hour bump interval)
* [Liam](https://top.gg/bot/389604896606781440) (2100 servers, 1 hour bump interval)

<!-- * [Bump Bot](https://discordbots.org/bot/511167075801235478) (325 servers, 24 hour bump interval) // Can not be found on top.gg/discordbots.org -->
Use ServerMate at your own risk. I don't suggest it as it require Administrator and a `#bump` channel in the server to bump.

### Listing Servers
Aside from websites and bot-served servers. Please note that servers may require you to stay in the server to keep your advertisement. Servers are ordered alphabetically. [This Google spreadsheet by cats#5485](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ia8VYVrnggQR1Kvb982DzbjZMXjqqrtETPVE9ri7Jag/edit#gid=0) provides a more detailed comparison of various servers. We are only listing the well-maintained ones here.
